The aim of this project is to create a music app with a social aspect to it. The users will be able to discover nearby users who have similar music tastes and invite them to a music session, chat, call etc. The also aimed to create a unique UI for the music player. Behind the scenes, the app uses MusicKit to play songs so the user needs to have an Apple Music subscription. The project is still in its early stages with a lot to complete!
